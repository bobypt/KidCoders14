# Coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 🎉

Welcome to our **14-day coding adventure**!  
Each day has its own folder (`day1`, `day2`, …) with a **starter file** and a **README** explaining the tasks.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install VS Code
- Download here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install and open **Visual Studio Code**.

### 2. Install Git
- Download here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Install Git (accept all defaults).
- Restart your computer if needed.

### 3. Create a GitHub Account
Each kid can have their own account (or share one family account).
- Sign up here: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
- Choose a username and password.  
- Verify the email address.

### 4. Install VS Code Extensions
In VS Code, click the **Extensions tab** (icon with 4 squares) and search/install:
- **Live Server** → preview webpages instantly in your browser.  
- **Prettier** → formats code neatly.  
- **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (optional, helps with GitHub integration).  

### 5. Open This Repo
- Open **VS Code**.
- Click **File → Open Folder**.
- Select the folder where this project is saved.

## 🖥️ Running Your First Web Page
- Go to the folder `day1`.  
- Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.  
- Your first web page will open in the browser 🎉.  
- Edit the file in VS Code → refresh the browser (Live Server usually auto-reloads).

## 🌐 Saving Your Work with GitHub

### 1. Connect VS Code to GitHub
- In VS Code, click the **Source Control tab** (left side, branch icon).  
- If asked, sign in with your GitHub account.  
- Authorize VS Code to access GitHub.

### 2. Daily Workflow (UI only)
1. Open the **Source Control tab**.  
2. Type a short message (example: `Day 1 finished`).  
3. Click **Commit** (the checkmark button).  
4. Click **Sync Changes** (↕ icon) to upload to GitHub.  

That’s it — no terminal commands needed! 🚀

## 🗂 Repo Structure
```
day1/
  index.html
  README.md   <- Instructions & tasks
day2/
  ...
day3/
  ...
README.md      <- This file (how to get started)
```

## 🎯 Tips
- Do **one folder per day**.  
- Always read the `README.md` inside that day’s folder.  
- Be creative: colors, fonts, images — make it your own!  
- Share your progress by showing the web page to the family each evening.

# Day 1 – My First Web Page 🎉

Today you’ll create your very first web page using **HTML + CSS**.  
You already have a starter file (`index.html`). Open it in your browser to see what it looks like, then edit it to make it yours!

---

## ✅ Main Task
1. Change `[Your Name]` to your real name.
2. Change the **favorite color** text and also update the highlight color in the CSS.
3. Edit the **fun fact** to something about yourself.

## 🎨 10 Styling Ideas to Try
(Do as many as you like — be creative!)

1. Change the **background color** of the page.  
2. Make the **heading (h1)** a different color.  
3. Try a **different font** (`Courier`, `Verdana`, or `Comic Sans MS` 😉).  
4. Add a **border** around the page using CSS.  
5. Make the text **bigger or smaller** by changing `font-size`.  
6. Add an **image** of something you like using `<img src="...">`.  
7. Make your **name bold and colorful** with a CSS class.  
8. Change the **text alignment** (try `left`, `right`, or `center`).  
9. Add another paragraph about something fun you did this week.  
10. Use a **gradient background** (example: `background: linear-gradient(red, yellow);`).
